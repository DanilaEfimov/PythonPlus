## 🔍 What is Python+?

**Python+** is not just another transpiler or Python flavor — it’s a full pipeline that preprocesses, compiles, and postprocesses Python code with extended syntax and new capabilities.

It enables:

- `const` keyword for defining immutable variables
- Access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`
- Custom preprocessor logic (macros, includes, etc.)
- Custom compiler hooks
- Postprocessor features for optimization or code transformation

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Extendable compiler pipeline**
- 🔒 **C++-style access control** (`private`, `protected`, etc.)
- 🧊 **Immutable variables** using `const`
- 🧩 **Custom preprocessor syntax**
- 🔄 **Code transformations and analysis**
- 📦 Designed to integrate into existing Python workflows
